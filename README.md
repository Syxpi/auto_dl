## Features

What is Auto_dl? It is very simple.
This script is used to download several things.
- Docker and Portainer.
- The "Defaults-Tools" (which are Tools which I think are a bit obligatory in my opinion)
- Jellyfin (Useless if you have Plex Media Server or other)
- Uptime Kuma
- NGINX Proxy Manager*
- My Mom. Uh wait. No. it's not the case.
- And something else ! (The community is free to add features or modify existing ones. These will be checked by me and added if interesting.)

```* This feature will delete all existing web services on the server, such as Apache or NGINX, because the ports used by these services conflict with NGINX Proxy Manager. I don't want NGINX Proxy Manager to cause chaos and start fires on the server and end up in prison for the rest of my life. (I should probably calm down a bit...)```

## Tested Systems

This script has been tested on the following operating systems:

- Ubuntu 23.10 / 22.04 (Could not work on earlier versions)
- Debian 12 / Debian 11 (Could not work on earlier versions)
- CentOS 9 / 8 (didn't work because fuck yum and dnf, my script is based on apt)
- Fedora 38 (same reason for CentOS)

## Informations

This script has automatic updating.
So no need to come back here. Except to see what has been added.

You will need curl, git, sudo and jq installed on your server. If these 4 programs are not installed, it will not work perfectly or just destroy anything.

To install them:
```apt install curl git jq sudo -y```

Once this is done, you will just have to do this command:
```git clone https://github.com/Syxpi/auto_dl.git```

then do this :
```cd auto_dl && chmod a+x ./auto_dl.sh && ./auto_dl.sh```

And do not forget to give me your house and your credit card number (just kidding, don’t do it.)

**⚠ Run the Script in your User's directory (accessible via "cd $HOME") ⚠**
**because while doing my tests, I noticed that something I tried didn't work.**
**If anyone has a solution, please open an issue directly so they can give me the tips. because I'm totally stuck on this.**
